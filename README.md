Somehow, the default info.json in the For-Science QMK repo resulted in an inverted slave side regardless if I fixed the handednes/EEPROM when I flashed it. So I fixed it by modifying the info.json file. You can copy the code and paste to your local info.json file in your local folder. Let me know if you have any problem to do this. Its quite straight forward. 

The keymaps file is the current one flashed to this keyboard. The norwegian character ÅåÆæØø is acccessed using the unicode in Layer 1 (MACRO) with tap dance for capital character, the keybaord layout must be in US layout by default, of course, you can change it as you like.
